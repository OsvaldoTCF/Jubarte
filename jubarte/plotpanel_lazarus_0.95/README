PlotPanel is a component for Lazarus to replace (more or less) the TChart component.
There is a Delphi version of this component (see my website)

With PlotPanel you can draw line- , dot- and bar-graphs. Animated graphs are also possible.

To Install the PlotPanel component in Lazarus you have to do the
following:
Go with your mouse to the menubar.
Then select "Components" in the menubar.
You will see a roll-down menu where you have to select  "Open package file".
Then you will see a new window. On the top you will see "Unit file name" with at the right-hand side a button labled "Browse". When You click that button you can go to the directory where you unpacked the PlotPanel.pas file.
Select the PlotPanel.pas file and click the "Open" button.Then Click the OK button at the bottom.
You will now see a new window with at the top left a button "Compile". Click this button. After that you can close the window with the cross-button at the top right. 
I suppose there will be an aditional question now on wich you have to 
say yes (I am not sure about that, because the component is already installed here, so I cannot find out).
After you have done that all, there must be a new Tab in the componet palet with the name "Extra".
You can use the Plotpanel now

Run the PlotPanelDemo to explore the features of PlotPanel.
N.B. You can try PlotPanel without installing the componet by running
TryPlotPanel!
